# This factory is used to implement the loading of the training data 
# from a file to the machine. Based on the requirement, The data can
# be loaded to the CPU RAM or the GPU Global memory. If the memory 
# requirement is too large for the GPU, the code will fail at this 
# point. Currently, no preprpcessing is done on the data, and the raw 
# data is loaded. It works on the MNIST format image data for now.
